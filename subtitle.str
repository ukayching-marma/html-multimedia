WEBVTT

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.840
hey guys welcome to the live by

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.480
intellipaat i am ram and i'll be the one

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.039
covering the live today so guys today

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.520
we'll be learning how to start coding

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.039
so if you're a fresher or if you're

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.480
someone who's just interested into

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480
getting into coding then this live is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.920
for you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.679
all right so in this session you know uh

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.440
we'll basically be discussing a lot of

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.520
different topics that will pertain to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.320
how you can start with coding

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.000
all right guys now

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.840
we always do this for our youtube

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.879
regulars but if are new here please

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.719
stick till the end because there is a

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.399
surprise for you

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.000
all right so now let's take a quick look

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.680
at our agenda

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.760
so in our session today we'll be

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.039
discussing different topics and these

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.760
are the different topics first why learn

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.879
coding

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.120
then we'll move on to how you can start

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.960
coding for yourself how will you start

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.600
it then third we'll discuss which

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.840
languages should you start with which

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.520
language should you choose

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.600
then we'll discuss how you can choose a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.119
project we'll discuss what this

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.040
particular topic is and then we'll

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.880
discuss the learning path what is the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.320
learning path you should take and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.840
finally we will conclude by discussing

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.280
what are the different kinds of jobs you

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.720
can get in this particular field

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.640
so guys let's go ahead and start the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.960
session so our first question here is

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.000
our first

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.759
discussion topic

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.759
why learn coding

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.400
so this is the question for you as well

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.520
as me

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.840
why should you learn coding

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.880
and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.119
do you really want to learn it

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.439
so let's actually discuss a story

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.439
so we have a person

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.280
and this person wants to earn a very

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.880
high salary

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.320
they don't know what they want to do in

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.920
life but they just know they want to

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.920
learn they want to earn a very high

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.880
salary so they decide to become a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.960
software engineer or software developer

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.439
because they heard that it pays a lot

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.280
then there is a person who's just

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.680
interested in coding and in developing

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.160
in programming so they take up this

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.319
particular field of coding programming

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.000
just because they're interested in this

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.120
field

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.520
and then there's this third person

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.920
he is he has already been working in a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.599
particular field suppose he's a business

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.480
analyst

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.239
now he's been working since the 90s or

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.360
the 80s and during that time they didn't

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.920
use any such you know special algorithms

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.720
to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.879
think about the data and make powerful

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.000
decisions

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.160
but these days the market has to change

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.879
and he has to adapt with the market to

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.360
incorporate coding into his own you know

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.879
working culture so that he can make

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.640
better decisions based on the data that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.840
is being collected you know how data

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.040
science works right

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.360
so all these three people have the same

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.720
goal in mind

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.120
they want to become

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.000
better at coding they want to become

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.239
coders or programmers they want to

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.840
become programmers at least they want to

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.000
learn what coding is or how to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.680
work with coding

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.239
so these can be a few of the reasons why

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.879
you would want to become a coder

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.400
maybe you want to get a really high

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.480
paying job maybe you're just interested

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.640
in coding maybe you just you know

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.720
learning coding to adapt with the change

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.640
you know with the market adapt to the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.000
market adapt to the change that's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.159
happening to the market

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.640
so you should ask yourself why do you

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.440
want to learn coding now this is

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.720
important

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.640
you should ask this question to yourself

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.560
because you know if you don't have the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.200
motive of your learning in mind

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.599
properly then you will you know follow

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.599
the horse you once you start learning

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.200
coding if you see you know come across

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.360
an error then you if you're not able to

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.040
solve that error then you know you stop

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.159
doing it because you don't have any

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.799
proper motivation so make sure that you

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.799
have a proper motivation in your mind

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.480
when you start off by learning what

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.599
coding is

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.480
so ask yourselves this question why do

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.519
you want to learn coding

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.200
all right guys now let's discuss how you

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.519
can start coding

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.439
by yourself okay

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.560
so

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.120
you can start coding off

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.799
you know basically

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.959
by figuring out what you want to do all

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.720
right so let's discuss this

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.478
so now you've asked yourself that you

00:04:16.478 --> 00:04:18.478
know what what is your motive to become

00:04:18.478 --> 00:04:20.160
become a coder what is you why do you

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.400
want to program now you have to go ahead

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.160
with the next step that is to learn how

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.680
to start coding

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.000
so coding you know this is a very

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.400
generic term how to start coding it's a

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.160
very vast field you know computer

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
science is a very vast field there are

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.240
so many different fields you can get

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.120
into

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.919
so you have to narrow it down so you

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.360
know this is like problem solving you

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.520
have a very big problem you divide into

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.680
smaller parts and then solve it so

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.280
similarly with this question of how to

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.600
start coding you need to divide it into

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.919
a smaller component

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:52.720
so

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.800
with the question how to start coding

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.600
you should first go ahead and narrow it

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.080
down to where do you want to code or how

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.080
do you want to code so first you need to

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.280
figure out what do you want to do with

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.960
coding do you want to develop an

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.199
application do you want to make a bot do

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.000
you want to develop a website what kind

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
of thing do you want to do so once

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.400
you've figured that out you should go

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.759
ahead

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.240
and learn what are the languages and the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.280
tools that are required for the

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.560
particular thing let me give you an

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.280
example like of the person who is just

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.039
interested in coding but he's not he's

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.560
never gotten the recording he's just

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.160
heard about how hacking is so cool and

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.880
he wants to get into coding so he starts

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.560
off by first

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.240
deciding what kind of projects he wants

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.120
to do

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.759
so he wants to do a project where he's

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.199
going to be making a recommendation

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.199
system on a website but the thing is

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.800
this recommendation system does not use

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.639
any powerful algorithms or something

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:47.840
it's just for him

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.320
to share a few details with his family

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.400
because the family lives far apart

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.320
so he just wants to share a few details

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.080
with them so

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.479
to do that he just made this application

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.400
so see it has a practical use this

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.960
particular project and while doing this

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.319
project he's learning a lot of things

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.240
he's learning how to code a website he's

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.520
learning html css javascript php

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.680
database technology a lot of different

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.880
things

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.199
now this is how i recommend you should

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.800
go ahead with it too you should first

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.240
figure out what you want to do then

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.080
figure out what language and tool you

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.160
need for it then learn the basics of

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.919
that language like you know all the

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.360
different basics of a particular

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.680
language you should learn that and then

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.360
move ahead and make the application

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.000
now a few you know a disclaimer here

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.960
when you're going to make this

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.400
application make sure that the

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.240
application you're making is a very

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.440
simple one

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.759
because when you start off always start

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.520
with baby steps because if you start

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.880
with something gigantic if you want to

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.360
make like the whole facebook website

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.840
then you'll obviously fall off the first

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.440
step itself because you don't know where

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.360
to start from so if you're rather making

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.039
such a huge website what you can do is

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.800
you can just you know start by creating

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.199
a small website where you basically can

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.280
create accounts and you know post

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.919
statuses that's it

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.240
so this is how you i suggest you guys

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.479
should start off by you know i should

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.199
start coding

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:16.400
all right

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.280
so

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.880
first that is figure out what you want

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.639
to do so let me give an example so you

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.000
can do a lot of things you can make a

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.080
small game so if you're into gaming and

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.000
you want to make a you know a particular

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.280
smart you know you want to get into the

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.360
gaming industry you want to become a

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.400
game developer

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.160
then you should start over making a very

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.000
small game you know app

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.639
not an apps per se like a particular

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.280
like a snake ladders you know snake game

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.520
the one we had on nokia mobiles like

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.599
that that sort of a game a very simple

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:46.879
one like you know um

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:48.879
the you know the defender

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.160
the defender game where you're basically

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.639
shooting aliens from you know below

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.479
and if you're not that then you can go

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:56.160
ahead and make a web application or a

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
mobile application a very simple one per

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.919
sale you know like uh you know very

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:01.360
small things in mobile traffic you're

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.039
going to make a mobile app i would

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:04.400
recommend not going for a mobile app

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.440
right now but if you're really

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.120
interested in making a mobile app then

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.639
you can go ahead and make a very simple

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.400
app that just opens up and tells you

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.199
what the time is so that way

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:15.680
so then this way first figure out what

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.000
you really want to do

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.599
as a project then figure out what are

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.440
the languages and tools you can use so

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.879
there are a lot of languages out there

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:24.160
that you can use

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.440
like let me give you that you have

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.440
python c plus plus javascript and you

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.599
have similarly tools with them that you

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:31.280
know that you have to use with them you

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.039
can use your ides that integrated

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.640
development environments you know

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.880
basically where you write the code

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.120
and you need compilers and all those

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.000
tools so figure out what do you need

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.919
with all of this so to give you a better

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.760
idea let's take an example of you know

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.959
you want to make a web application so

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:50.160
you've decided that you're going to be

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.000
making that web application where you're

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.640
basically going to be displaying time of

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.240
all the family members that are living

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.920
across the globe

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.279
and then you decide to choose a

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.120
particular language you go ahead using

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.320
javascript because you know that is

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.000
what's used to create the front end you

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.160
use javascript html css to make the

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.480
front end and then you decide to use a

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.920
particular tool maybe you're using

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.240
visual studio code as the place where

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.399
you write the javascript code so that is

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.240
the tool you're using

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.920
then you learn the basics of that

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.920
language now javascript will have a lot

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.760
of different basics but it has some

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.240
coding basics also like you know you

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.399
have your loops like for loops while

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.080
loops then you have if statements then

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.360
you have variables then you have

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.040
functions and arrays

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.800
so these are like a kind of the basics

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.600
of the particular language

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.720
not just the language these are

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.399
fundamentals of any language when you're

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.839
working with any language you'll have

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:41.279
loops if statements variables and

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.040
functions and arrays

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.040
and similarly you know that example of

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.480
you know making that website you're

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.680
learning javascript so you'll have to

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.959
learn these and then you have to learn

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:50.560
the basics of the language itself you'll

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.080
have to learn a little bit of html a

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.839
little bit of css a little bit of

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:55.680
javascript and once you learn all of

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.360
those you know the fundamentals of all

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.640
of those things then you can go ahead

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.000
and create the application that you want

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.120
to

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.079
now and then create a basic application

00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:06.160
so now you know he's he knows what he

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.560
wants to create and he's creating it

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.560
then so the process of creation when

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.640
he's creating the web application he'll

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.640
be learning a lot of things he'll be

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.640
learning how to create functions in

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.880
javascript he'll be learning how to

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.839
place

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.480
certain things using css how to color

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.880
them how to make it more fancy looking

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.200
and how to you know divide the content

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.360
using html so a lot of different things

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.560
you'll be learning when you're creating

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.959
this application now remember a very

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:34.640
important factor here is that you should

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.480
not go for something that is complicated

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.920
you should go for something that is very

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.160
simple if you go for very simple then

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.760
you know yeah in the starting it feels

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.519
like oh i'm not doing anything but

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.279
actually learning so if you complete

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:47.440
this application right then you should

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.880
give yourself a pat on the back because

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.120
you've done something amazing you

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.800
started from not knowing anything

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.360
encoding to create a basic application

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.360
yeah that's a good step once you've

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.720
learned this then you should go ahead

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.040
for different other applications like

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.720
once you complete your first project do

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.920
a second project this time when you're

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.200
doing a second project make sure that

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.120
it's a little bit more complicated again

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.880
not so complicated as making a whole

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.800
facebook website make it a little bit

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.480
more complicated so that you know you

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.120
can work with it and learn new things

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.360
with it so you know the whole cycle

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.440
repeats you define an aim again you

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.360
choose the particular language well

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.279
you've already chosen the language you

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:25.360
choose what are the libraries you're

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.720
going to use all the different tools

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.680
you're going to use and you're going to

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.560
learn how to use them so this way slowly

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.120
slowly doing projects you'll learn how

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.120
to become a coder

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.800
so guys that is how you're going to

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.279
start coding

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:41.600
all right so let me just brief you know

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.440
briefly tell you like how you should

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.519
choose what kind of language what kind

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:47.519
of tools you need to use so all those

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:49.279
things let me just brief you on that so

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.720
when it comes to which language should

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.800
you choose not just for working with

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.720
your project maybe you're thinking okay

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.480
so i've understood this guy's way but i

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.839
just want to start with the language

00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:58.959
i've heard of all these different

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:02.000
languages c plus plus java python so

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
which language should i choose you know

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.560
so that really depends because there are

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.680
a lot of different factors here

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.680
so you have a lot of languages out there

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.839
you have python kotlin c plus plus c

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:14.880
sharp

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.800
javascript swift java ruby php node.js r

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.320
there are so many different languages

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.639
for so many different use cases

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:25.360
so again you would have to define our

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.680
aim for yourself up define a particular

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.839
project for yourself so that you know

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:31.040
you can

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.320
learn though

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.560
all these tools and languages

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.399
on the journey

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.560
there because if you have a name you

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.560
won't falter you won't you know if you

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.560
have an error you will try to solve it

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.839
you will try to solve it because you

00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:46.240
have a aim and you want to accomplish

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.480
that aim so that's why

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.000
so choosing a language

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.959
well

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:54.560
i would actually recommend you guys

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.760
start off with python itself well python

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.360
and javascript are pretty easy to start

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.200
off with but personally i would

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.360
recommend python because python is one

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.839
of the most easiest languages out there

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:08.399
now it's very easy to learn like the

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:10.720
learning curve is not very steep it's a

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.639
very gradual curve so you can learn

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:15.440
easily with python it's got very simple

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.519
syntax you know you know you don't have

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:19.680
to type complicated syntax for it you

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.120
can you have a lot of different

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.120
tutorials and guides out there we

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.279
ourselves in telepath have a very long

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:27.440
lecture that gives you everything you

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.760
need to know about python so right now

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.079
you can open up another tab and type in

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:33.920
python telepath and you'll find a very

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.000
good video that will explain to you how

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
you can start coding with python and if

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.079
you're especially a fresher who doesn't

00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:41.519
know what he wants to do then you should

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:42.959
definitely check this out because it

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:44.560
will give you an idea about coding

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.639
itself and you'll be getting python now

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:48.880
remember i said that python is simple

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.240
now it's simple doesn't mean it's bad

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.600
python has so many different use cases i

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.519
can't even list them down right now a

00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:59.040
few of them might be software

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.600
development you know data science

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.839
and creating bots writing scripts there

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:05.360
are so many things you can do with

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.399
python and python is very powerful a lot

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:10.800
of different enterprises make use of

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.760
python for their particular applications

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.279
and whatever they're working with you

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:17.440
know the projects they use python python

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.360
is a very important language

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.199
so i suggest you guys to start off with

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:22.639
python

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:25.519
you know if you want to learn python you

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:27.680
can start off by you know looking at the

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.760
different tutorials different guides and

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.279
if you think you need a

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:33.199
you know certification in python because

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:35.600
maybe you don't have a cs degree you did

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.680
not pass out with you know cs or you

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.440
don't have a degree yet

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.600
then you should definitely get certified

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.160
as a python developer and we provide the

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.880
same also

00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:52.959
again there's a

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.199
minus asterisk over here if you have

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:56.480
other languages that you've already

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.760
worked on suppose this is a different

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.760
use case like this is uh for the case of

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.800
a person

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.680
who has done some work in c plus plus

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.360
but he and he stopped coding for some

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.880
time because he thought that this is not

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.880
what he wanted to get into but later he

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.240
realized his passion again when he

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.480
started playing games again so he wants

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.639
to get back into coding the whole game

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:16.720
then that in that way then you should

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.920
not start off with python maybe you

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.079
should start off with c plus itself or

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:21.360
whatever language you've worked with

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.040
because then you already have a basic

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.160
understanding

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.600
and

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.639
you've already had the basic

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:28.000
understanding then you can go ahead with

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.480
the advanced topics also

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.720
again choosing a language can be

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.399
difficult in another way also because

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:36.480
you have a lot of different things like

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.720
uh to take in fact like what kind of

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.639
project you're building so

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:42.480
i told you guys if you want to start off

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.839
with just a language you should start

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:45.279
with python but if you want to start off

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.480
with a particular project suppose you're

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.880
making an ios app then you should

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.519
definitely you know use swift

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:52.560
swift

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.639
is as you can see this is swift instead

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:56.720
of you know using javascript you can't

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.560
use it so you need to use swift if

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.920
you're working with android then you

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.600
need to work with java and kotlin or if

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.959
you're working with any websites and you

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:05.440
need to know again javascript html css

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.440
node.js php django all these different

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.040
kinds of languages or if you want to

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.880
become a data scientist and then you

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.959
have to work with python again and then

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:15.360
either r or matlab also you can work

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.360
with any three of these and then

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.880
software development if you want to get

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.399
into software development c-sharp and

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:22.000
java are a good choice and then game

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.519
development if you're really into you

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:24.959
know creating games then you can start

00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:27.519
off by learning c plus plus and c sharp

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:30.079
so again guys there are a lot of factors

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.519
here deciding what kind of language you

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:33.839
want to choose i suggest python because

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:36.079
the python is really easy to do you know

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.160
use and it has a lot of use cases it has

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.079
really powerful algorithms that you can

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:41.920
use and a lot of powerful libraries that

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.399
you can make use of

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:45.920
all right guys so other than languages

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.920
what kind of tools can you use so you

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.560
know debugging so what is debugging

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.560
so if once you start coding right you

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.399
will find a lot of errors in your code

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:55.839
like maybe you made a

00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:58.240
you know a page of code and it basically

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.199
tells you the time and

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:02.480
right now it's not working in the

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.839
compiler you're getting a particular

00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:05.359
error you're getting an error that this

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.520
particular thing is missing so how do

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.280
you check that out because in a starting

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.400
you'll be working by yourself because

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.240
you're learning the basics so you can

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.919
make use of google

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:15.760
google is one of the best tools out

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.640
there search that error whatever error

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.799
you get search it if you search it

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:22.160
you'll find that there are other people

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.720
out there who made similar mistakes like

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.119
you know like you've made

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.559
that's why i wouldn't recommend ever

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:30.880
starting with a book because with a book

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.440
you are narrowed down and you can't ask

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.600
anyone for help so learning online is

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.000
like a really good opportunity so use

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.080
google in your debugging so debugging

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.000
would be basically removing that bug

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.840
that is the error and you google it and

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.120
you'll find a lot of different sources

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.799
that will tell you how you can solve

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.559
your error and this is where stack

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:50.640
overflow comes now stack overflow is

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.760
something you're going to be hearing a

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.160
lot of times like stack overflow is very

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.919
important if you're getting into coding

00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:58.080
so remember stack overflow is basically

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.840
a place it's like quora but it's for

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.400
like technical stuff you ask questions

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.640
and people will try to answer back with

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.559
you know uh people who are suppose

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:08.240
you're answering a question in python

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.080
then peop a person who's really you know

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.960
um

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.480
good at python will try to answer a

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.480
question now stack overflow has a really

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.880
good community but we in telepath also

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.080
have a really good community if you go

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.160
ahead and ask a question then we will

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.679
also there will be people in our

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:23.360
community that will try to answer these

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.600
questions also so this is how you can

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.440
you know solve your debugging and try

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.400
debugging

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.840
and these are your debugging tools and

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.600
then you have version control systems

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.840
now remember guys if you're working

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.080
uh on software development right then

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.480
you'll definitely be using working you

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.960
know writing code you'll be coding so

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.640
where will you write you know store this

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.600
code so if i wanted to give you a brief

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.600
uh explanation of what gate is git is

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.440
basically a place where you store your

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.799
code

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:53.200
and why i wrote version control system

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.600
here is because so when you're writing

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.039
your like let's take an example if you

00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:58.799
have a project right your project might

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:00.960
have different like your first iteration

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.480
of a project you made your project and

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.160
it works really fine but now you want to

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.760
add more features to it so once you

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.280
start adding more features to it you

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.880
create a new version of your project

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.320
it's like having different versions of

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.160
an app you'll have uh application

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.520
version one application version two

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.840
application version three now for codes

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.080
of all of those threes will be stored

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.400
separately and that's how you that's why

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.240
like that's a basic explanation of what

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.240
git will be doing for you so if you're

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.480
confused right now don't worry just get

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.320
just learn how to use git it is very

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.880
important for any coder out there and

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.320
know that it basically is used for

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.760
storing your code

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.039
then you have your integrated

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.640
development environment so you have

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.200
intellij visual studio and android

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.440
studio all of these different studios

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.600
are basically places where you write the

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.880
code now you're writing the code in them

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.400
and you're making use of the

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.480
functionality they give you now suppose

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.640
you're writing your code in one of these

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.200
ides integrated development environments

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.240
and you want to use a piece of code

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.559
that is very long and you don't want to

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:02.240
write it from the scratch

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.400
so you can just use the libraries it

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.400
provides you or any plug-in separately

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.000
so just remember that id is a place

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.200
where you're going to be writing a code

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.799
and using a lot of its functionalities

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:12.559
from here and there so guys these are

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:14.960
the different tools you'll need to know

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.600
and choose you know basically choose the

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.919
tool based on the language like or

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:22.799
choose any integrated like there are

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:23.919
different integrated development

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:25.440
environments out there you have a visual

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.640
studio code that can be used for

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.480
different languages also but it's mainly

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.320
used for c sharp c plus plus visual

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.400
basic and etc and if you want to work

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.840
with python you have your integrated

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.240
development i you know environment like

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.679
idle or pycharm etc

00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:41.679
all right guys now how do you choose go

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:43.600
ahead and choose a project

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.840
now choosing a project is as important

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.080
as completing the project itself because

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.320
you're going to be you know

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.400
using this as your main objective your

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.480
main goal

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.600
it's like

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.360
you know suppose you're taking

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.360
you're going to be making a bot you're

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.520
going to be making a bot that posts

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.840
questions on facebook for you

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.679
so that is your project that is your

00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:06.960
main goal

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.039
and make sure you keep it a very simple

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:11.600
one again a disclaimer guys

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.520
so if you are going to be starting to

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.440
code make sure that the project you're

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.120
choosing is a very simple project

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.120
even though it's simple it still sets a

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.799
goal for you right

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:24.240
and now you know that you're going to be

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.679
starting off simple and you're going to

00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:27.280
be choosing a project so how do you

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.559
choose a project

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:31.600
so guys choosing off a project you know

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.480
the first thing you should do is

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.880
make sure that it's simple okay and the

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.240
next thing ask yourself a question

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.240
ask yourself what are you interested in

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.240
suppose you sitting there viewing right

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.960
now are very interested in cricket

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.760
and

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.280
you want to get into coding so what you

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.200
can do is you can basically create a

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.880
website

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.480
or you can create a website that

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.720
basically lists down all the famous

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.280
cricketers out there sachin or adam

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.919
gilchrist serve richards you can you

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:03.840
know basically list you can create this

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.679
can be your project where you're writing

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:07.360
you know listing down all the different

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.200
greatest players out there on your

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.760
website so that can be a project so ask

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.120
yourself what are you interested in it

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.400
can't just be cricket it can be a lot of

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.480
different things and make a project

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.360
based on that or you if you if you want

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.679
you can do this also you can basically

00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.840
check out uh ask you know

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.320
see if your family is having issues ask

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.159
them and make sure that it's a little

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:30.080
bit simple or ask them what issues

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.919
they're facing suppose they're not able

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:34.080
to contact you properly i know we have

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.600
thoughts out these days but just imagine

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.120
we didn't have whatsapp and they want to

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.559
contact you with you

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:40.400
they want to maintain contact with you

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.400
so you can make a very simple messaging

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.440
on a very basic email application where

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.960
you're you know sending mail to them

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.240
they're receiving they're sending it

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.559
back to you a similar use case try to

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:52.799
think of an idea that you like or do you

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:55.280
have you want to do it passionately and

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.760
choose that as your project now again

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.280
once you've decided what you want to do

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.400
you that

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.919
particular thing will fall into a domain

00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:03.280
now i said that you could be creating a

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.880
website now website will fall into a

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.960
domain of web development so there are

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.280
multiple different web domains so let's

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.200
discuss them so you have web development

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.640
web development you can see all the

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.799
different languages you'll be choosing

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:16.799
like your javascript html css node.js

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:17.919
php

00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:20.320
django etc and you guys see if you

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.080
notice django is basically used for

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.159
writing the backend and it again is

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:26.159
based on python so you see how important

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:27.360
python is

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.640
then you have a different domain like

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.480
android we're using java and kotlin then

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.440
you're using ios swift and for data

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.760
science and data engineering have python

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.559
r matlab software development java c

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:39.919
python again

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.919
game development c plus plus c sharp so

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:43.840
you have so many different domains you

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.600
can choose from choose the one that

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.960
you're interested in

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.480
and

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.480
try to find that and try to find

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.679
something that has a use

00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:55.360
all right guys

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.760
so i've told you how you can start

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.200
coding you know

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.120
now let's see the learning path for a

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.880
coder

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.120
so as a you know in learning path you'll

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.520
be you know do so first of all what you

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.760
should do is you should make sure

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.600
that you're learning online because uh

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.600
you can learn in classes also but online

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.760
is just much more easier you have your

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.360
own self-paced and you can do it by

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.480
yourself

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.880
so i recommend trying and going on you

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.640
know those websites out there like free

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.120
code camp that provide you know help you

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.679
in coding they basically

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:29.360
give you small tutorials where you learn

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.279
the basics of coding

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:33.440
or if you want

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.679
if you want to be instructed by someone

00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:38.000
if you want to be uh you know taught by

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.240
someone who has had a years of

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.320
experience in a particular language then

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.679
you can get

00:24:43.679 --> 00:24:46.960
online courses now we here at intel park

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.640
provide a lot of different courses and

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.159
if you're choosing a language like

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:53.840
suppose you choose in python you have a

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.760
lot of things you can do you have the

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.000
python certification training so

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.880
basically you will be taught by mul you

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.440
know different by people

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.600
who are well versed in python who've

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.600
been working with python for years in

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.880
the industry they have a lot of

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.799
experience so if you have any doubt they

00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:12.840
will be able to answer it without any

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.480
hesitation or at least they will try to

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.640
so that is get certified you know

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.159
certification can help you a lot

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:22.240
especially if you don't have a cs degree

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.840
or if you don't have a degree if you

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.760
don't have a degree at all it's okay

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.760
doesn't matter just get try to get a

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.000
certification and build your skills

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.919
build your skills add projects to your

00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:34.400
resumes do all of those things they will

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.400
greatly help you out and if you're a

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.279
person who does not have any you know

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:41.679
any any degree that is relevant like you

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:43.679
don't have a cs degree or an ec degree

00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:45.679
then again that is also fine

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:47.679
coding is something that is easy to

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:50.080
start with you can easily start it off

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.840
and get into it really easily also

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.440
all right guys so let's move back

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.640
all right guys so in your learning path

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.240
you should start up in learning the

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.919
basics of the coding you've chosen a

00:26:09.919 --> 00:26:11.840
field already you know your domain the

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.760
project the tools the language you'll be

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.159
working with then go ahead and learn all

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:18.000
the basics learning the basics should

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.559
take you about a month i mean if you're

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:22.000
if you're you know

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.279
starting from beginning you'd know

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:24.720
nothing about coding you're starting off

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.640
from scratch even then will just take

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.640
you a month to learn all the basics of

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.320
the fundamentals of coding out there

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.840
especially if you're you know working

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.159
with python from there on learning the

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:36.320
advanced topics may take up to a few

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.320
months and mastering them even may take

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.320
up to a year now have you heard of any

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.320
skill that you know you can complete and

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.559
learn so easily so fast

00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:46.880
well coding is that particular field you

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.279
can learn the basics very fast you can

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:51.279
master the you know

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:53.520
advanced elements also pretty fast

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.120
etc

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.200
so you know what for learning path what

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.880
you can do is you can either get

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.440
certified from uh any of the companies

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.360
out there like in telepath we provide a

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.039
certification where people help you out

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:06.320
you know you have your online

courses that we give out for free like

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:21.440
uh they don't have projects with them

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.000
and you know nobody teaches you like no

and ask a question if you're having any

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.120
query doubts

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.120
so guys that was it for learning path

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.279
you know you basically gotten to know

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:05.840
how you can start coding so you use the

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.159
knowledge i've given you okay

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:09.200
all right so

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.279
the last thing we're going to discuss is

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:14.000
what kind of jobs can you expect

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.120
now

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.039
you've gotten into coding you've at

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.960
least got an idea and let's just give

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.640
you the juicy part now what kind of jobs

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.919
can you expect so there are different

00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:23.279
fields out there you have your cloud

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:24.960
computing software development game

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.039
development machine learning data

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:29.440
science big data web development there

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.520
are so many different domains out there

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.600
for you to choose because you know you

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.440
can use coding in all of these different

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.960
fields obviously coding is not going to

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.399
be the only thing

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:39.840
you know you'll start off by coding

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.000
you'll master the elements of coding

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.960
then you will go ahead and specialize in

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.960
few areas if you suppose let me give you

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.159
an example if you're you know going to

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:49.840
cloud computing you'll learn the

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.360
architecture of the cloud so that is

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.120
again a knowledge you're getting if

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.559
you're going to software development you

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:56.799
know you'll have to

00:28:56.799 --> 00:28:59.360
utilize all the different uh devops

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.520
things and cloud a lot of different

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.399
things you'll be using software

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:04.000
development and game development is a

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.399
you know a very new field also it

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:08.559
started off recently

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:11.440
and it also has a lot of opportunities

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.799
it's going to be a little bit more

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:14.559
different than all the other fields but

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:16.960
it utilizes a lot of elements from the

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.799
other fields as well as coding

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:20.399
and then you have machine learning this

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:22.399
is a very good you know like a very big

00:29:22.399 --> 00:29:24.720
buzz word because machine learning is

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.640
like a very sought after job a lot of

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.600
people

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.760
go ahead and learn you know

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.960
get very good at machine learning and

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.360
get paid really high salaries because

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.679
you know machine learning is the future

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:37.120
then you have data science you know

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.720
where you're basically studying the data

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.240
so you'll be making use of lot of other

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.720
elements like mathematics and statistics

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.559
but you'll be using coding also and

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:46.320
again for data science you guys know

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.159
python is very important python is

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:49.679
important for so many things then you

00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:51.440
have big data

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.039
where you'll be you know analyzing a lot

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:55.840
of data coming in so and then you have

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.600
web development so guys these are just a

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.279
few domains that i've listed there are a

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:01.279
lot more domains out there you can look

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:02.559
for them yourselves because if your

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.559
interest lies in this particular field

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:06.799
then you can go and get you know look at

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:08.320
that particular field suppose let me

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.799
give that qriket example again so

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:13.440
you know uh data data analysis happens

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.960
in cricket also because you know you

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.960
have to figure out uh how long the

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.640
player will last on the field how many

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.919
runs will you make

00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:22.559
and how's the weather going to be so in

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.240
even that kind of field you'll be using

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.640
coding so look at the field you are

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.159
interested in

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:30.880
find a particular topic that you want to

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.039
do like a project you want to do

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:35.120
figure out what are the different uh

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.799
lang what is the language you need to

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:38.159
learn what are the different tools

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:40.080
you'll need and then go ahead and make

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.799
that application a simple one

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:45.200
all right guys as the code says here an

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.600
investment in knowledge always pays best

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.440
interest

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.360
that basically is saying you know you

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.559
invest a little money on in little time

00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:57.120
in learning a particular thing

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.200
like coding and you know it'll pay off

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.080
in the future it'll help you out a lot

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.399
all right guys who are new here or even
